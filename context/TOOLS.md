| Service | Trusted with | Credentials live | Crossing statement | Switching cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bolt.new | Project context, the feature prompt, and the files supplied for the role-suggestion feature | Bolt.new account | "I sent project context, a feature prompt, and implementation files to Bolt.new to generate the role-suggestion feature, and I am accountable for reviewing and integrating its output." | Low: implement manually or use another AI builder, then repeat the integration review |
| Cloudflare Workers + D1 | Every entry a user types; request metadata (IP, timestamp) that Cloudflare logs by default | Cloudflare dashboard login; wrangler token inside the Codespace | "User entries leave the browser and are stored on D1 under Cloudflare's free-tier terms, in a region I did not choose. I am accountable." | Medium: `wrangler d1 export`, rewrite one Worker for another host |
| GitHub + Codespaces | Source code, commit history, branch metadata, and the devcontainer setup used to run the project in the cloud | GitHub account (SSO) | "My code, commit history, and the devcontainer setup cross to GitHub and Codespaces so the project can run in the browser and in the cloud, and I am accountable." | Low: disconnect the repository from Codespaces and move the project to a local or self-hosted environment |
| GitHub Copilot | Repository content, prompts, and code context used to generate suggestions | GitHub account | "My repository contents and prompts cross to GitHub Copilot so it can suggest code, and I am accountable for reviewing and accepting what it returns." | Low: disable Copilot and use a local editor or another AI tool |
| Google Gemini 3.6 Flash (STANDARDS drafting) | The five team members' HW5 `STANDARDS.md` files | Google Gemini account | "I, Aaron Rahim, sent the five members' STANDARDS files to Gemini to merge them into the team standard. I am accountable for checking that conflicts preserve the stricter rule and are documented." | Low: merge the source standards manually and review the resulting file |
| Google Gemini API (Phase 2 Worker) | User-entered skillset sent by the Worker to generate role suggestions | `GEMINI_API` Cloudflare Worker secret | "The Phase 2 Worker sends a user's skillset to Google Gemini for role suggestions. I, Aaron Rahim, am accountable for limiting the data sent, protecting the credential, and reviewing the response." | Medium: replace the model/API and update its request schema, validation, and tests |
| wrangler (npm) | Project config, Worker metadata, and local Cloudflare login state while I deploy and manage the app | None in the repo, but it holds the Cloudflare login token above | "The project config and deploy metadata cross to Wrangler and Cloudflare when I authenticate and publish the Worker, and I am accountable for what I deploy." | Medium: install a different deployment tool or migrate the Worker to another platform |
